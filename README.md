# Java8-Functional-Interfaces-and-Lambda-Expressions

## Why Lambdas

  1) Enable Functional Programming: We can use function as an entity that can pass around.
  2) Readable and Concise Code: Anonymous inner clas which is robust. Lambda make it readable and concise.
  3) Easier to Use API's and Libreries : It has the collection API and more libraries to enable the functional programming          model.
  4) Enable Support for Parallel Processing: Collection can go through the parallel stream.
    
##  Code in OOP

  1) Everything is an object.
  2) All code blocks are associated with classes and objects.

## Function as Values in Lambda

  Inline values -> 
  
  String name = "foo";
  double pi = 3.14;
  
  aBlockofCode={
    ......
    ......
  }

  -----------------------------
  
  aBlockofCode=public void perform(){
      system.out.println("Hello World");      
  }
